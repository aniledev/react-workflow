# React Workflow

## Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

- Routes and components should be single-minded
- Each page/route of your application should be a child of the top level App component
- Each page/route of your application can then be broken down into its single-minded components

## Step 2: Build A Static Version in React

- Create import statements and function/class components stubs for your React components to start with

## Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

## Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live

## Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow
